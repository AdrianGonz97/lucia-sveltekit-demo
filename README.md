# Lucia Sveltekit Demo

This is a demo to try out [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.vercel.app/), a _"user and session management library that provides an abstraction layer between your app and your database"_, with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). 

This is also using Lucia's OAuth package for Github's OAuth and my own implementation for Twitch's OAuth.

## Developing

Install the dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
# install deps
pnpm i
# start dev server
pnpm dev
```
